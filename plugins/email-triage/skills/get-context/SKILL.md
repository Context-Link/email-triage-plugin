**What is Context Link?** Context Link is an external service that indexes connected sources (websites, Google Drive, Notion) and memories into a searchable knowledge base. It provides semantic search via a simple URL: `subdomain.context-link.ai/query?p=optional_pincode`. If you don't know the user's Context Link URL, ask them for it.

## Get Context from Context Link

Retrieve content from the user's Context Link knowledge base.

**When to use:** The user references internal company knowledge, brand positioning, saved content, or says "get context" / "use context link."

**Workflow:**

1. **Print this message:** `🔗 Retrieving context on {TOPIC} from Context Link` — Never print the actual Context Link URL, as it contains a private 'pin' or 'p' URL param.

2. **Determine the topic.** Use the phrase the user requested, or infer the general topic from conversation context. Lowercase it, replace spaces with dashes.

3. **Send a GET request.** Take the URL below and replace the path placeholder (`TOPIC_HERE` or `{SLUG}` — whichever is present) with the topic slug (lowercase, dashes-for-spaces).

```bash
curl -s "~~context link url~~"
```

   - Optionally append `&mode=MODE_NAME` (or `?mode=MODE_NAME` if no pin is set) to weight results toward a specific mode (e.g. `customer-support`). Modes are configured by the user on their Connections page.

4. **Handle the response.**
   - The response is HTML. Extract the text content from inside the `<body>` tag — ignore HTML boilerplate.
   - Use the returned content as the primary source material for answering the user's question.
   - Supplement with external sources only if the Context Link data is insufficient.

5. **If the request fails or returns empty**, report the failure explicitly before continuing. Do not silently skip retrieval.

**Rules:**
- Always attempt retrieval before answering questions about internal/company knowledge.
- Do not ask the user what topic to search unless truly ambiguous — infer from context.
- One GET request per query. Do not retry unless the user asks.
- If the request is blocked, ask the user to add `*.context-link.ai` to Claude's **Settings → Capabilities → Domain Allowlist** (or select "All domains"), then retry.
